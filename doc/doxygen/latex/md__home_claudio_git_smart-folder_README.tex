\subsection*{Summary}

The project consists in developing a tool that creates a dynamic folder containing the result of a file search.

The tool is used by specifying a {\itshape destination} folder, a {\itshape source} folder and an optional filtering expression. The {\itshape destination} folder is created and inside is maintained an up-\/to-\/date list of symbolic links pointing to the files found within the {\itshape source} folder matchin the filtering expression.

The filtering expression syntax is closely inspired by the {\itshape find} command. The user may filter files according to the following criteria\+: {\itshape name$\ast$$\ast$, $\ast$group}, {\itshape owner}, {\itshape group owner}, $\ast$permission$\ast$$\ast$, $\ast$size$\ast$$\ast$, $\ast$access/modified/metadata time$\ast$$\ast$.

The criteria above may be combined using logical operators ({\itshape and, or, not}) or parenthesis.
