IPC:
 - convert dst path to absolute path (maybe do it in main)
 - removal of PID file should be done by ipc watch app
 - removal of PID file should happen if main app is closed

 main:
  - one should do smart_folder_create (that validates the parameters) beforecalling IPC_watch and smart_folder_start
  - remove IPC watch if smart_folder_start fails

GLOBAL:
  - set create permissions globally (UMASK?) for all file/dir creation
  - put MAX_PATH globally
  - ask teacher about usage of C lib functions instead of system functions.
     - opendir vs open & getdents
     - fopen vs open,etc
